### [Demo](https://esports-pickem.herokuapp.com/)

## Features:

* Select a region to vote for your favorites players in that region
* You can select up to 3 players in your chosen region
* You cannot select players in several regions, only one region
* You'll see a warning modal before you'd lose any picks - so don't worry
* Users can vote while votation is open
* Admins can vote while votation is open
* Admins can close the votation
* Closing the votation will show the players' percentage votes for that region

## Future improvements

* Add state persistence through LocalStorage or a DB
* Add Redux to for better state management between components
