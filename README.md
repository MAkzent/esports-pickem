### [Demo](https://esports-pickem.herokuapp.com/)

## Features:

* Select a region to vote for your favorites players in that region
* You can choose up to 3 players for just one region
* You cannot select players in several regions
* A warning modal will be triggered before you change regions and lose your picks
* Users can only vote while the voting is open
* Admins can close the votation and can also vote before closing
* The state of the app is not persistent yet, this could be solved by using LocalStorage or a real database
